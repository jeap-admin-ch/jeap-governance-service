    shortDescription: A jEAP service and library which provides a quick overview of system and service compliance with defined policies.
    longDescription: |
      The jEAP Governance Service is a compliance monitoring solution designed to help 
      development teams and administrators maintain adherence to organizational policies and best practices 
      across microservices and systems within the jEAP ecosystem.
      
      ## Purpose
      
      This service acts as a centralized compliance dashboard and policy enforcement framework, providing 
      visibility into compliance status across all managed services. A scheduled evaluation process 
      regularly checks services against defined rules and reports on compliance violations.
      
      ## Key Features
      
      - **Developer Feedback:** Teams receive clear information on whether their services comply with 
        organizational policies
      - **Flexible Rule Management:** Administrators can temporarily deactivate individual rules for 
        specific systems or services when exceptions are needed
      - **Extensible Rules Engine:** New compliance rules can be easily added through a plugin mechanism, 
        allowing teams to provide their own custom rules
      
      ## Architecture
      
      The service follows a modular, extensible architecture:
      
      - **Data Source Integration:** Automatically collects compliance-relevant information from various 
        sources including the Arch Repo service, Deployment Log service, Prometheus/Grafana metrics, and 
        project-specific data providers
      - **Scheduled Evaluation:** A cron job periodically evaluates all services against configured rules
      - **Plugin-Based Configuration:** Teams can configure the service and provide custom rules through a 
        flexible plugin mechanism
      
      ## Use Cases
      
      - Ensuring microservices meet requirements (e.g., authentication, compliance with requirements from architecture, ..)
      - Validating deployment configurations against established standards
      - Monitoring technical debt and deprecated dependency usage
      - Enforcing documentation and metadata requirements
      - Tracking observability and monitoring coverage
      
      The Governance Service helps maintain high-quality, compliant services across the jEAP platform 
      while providing the flexibility teams need to manage exceptions and evolve policies over time.
    features:
      - Developers receive feedback on whether they are complying with the rules.
      - An administrator can temporarily deactivate individual rules for individual systems or services
      - New rules can be easily added
